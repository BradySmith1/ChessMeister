CS364: ChessMeister

Authors: Brady Smith, Kaushal Patel, Zachary Eanes, and Colton Brooks.

DESCRIPTION:
This is a basic implementation of Chess, done through the command line. The board
itself is printed to the terminal, user input is taken in through command line, and
we are able to use the basic functions of chess. For this version, we have created a 
basic display of the board, and gave the user basic interactions in order to 
move pieces based on if the move itself is valid or not. User's will have a collection
of taken pieces displayed as well, making sure that the user is full caught up.
