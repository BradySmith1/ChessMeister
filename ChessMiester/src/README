Version: 2.0 (April 20, 2023)

                       ************   IMPORTANT NOTE   ************
In order for saving, loading, and some other features to work, this program must be opened in
the ChessMiester folder. This is because the program uses relative paths to access the files
that are needed to save and load games. If you open the program in the ChessMiester folder, it
will work as intended. If you open it in the src folder, it will not work as intended.


DESCRIPTION:
This is a basic implementation of Chess, done through the command line. The board
itself is printed to the terminal, user input is taken in through command line, and
we are able to use the basic functions of chess. For this version, we have created a 
basic display of the board, and gave the user basic interactions in order to 
move pieces based on if the move itself is valid or not. User's will have a collection
of taken pieces displayed as well, making sure that the user is full caught up. 

PIECES: 
K - King
Q - Queen
R - Rook
N - Knight
B - Bishop
P - Pawn

HOW TO RUN:
In order to run this program, first open the folder "ChessMiester" as the project, and then
create a new configuration in IntelliJ and set the build and run to Java Azul and target file
as ./controller/Driver.java. Then, you're able to run the program and play chess.

HOW TO PLAY:
In order to play this game, the user will be prompted to enter in a move. The user will enter
the file and rank of the piece they want to move, following by the file and rank of the
destination. The user will then be told if the move is valid or not, and if it is valid, the
board is updated and the next player's turn begins. This is repeated until the game meets an
ending condition, such as draw.

Along with this, there are many navigable features in the menu, including a functional saving
and loading of the game, tutorials in order to learn basic chess, and many more. Feel free to
explore the menu and see what you can find!
