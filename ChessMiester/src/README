DESCRIPTION:
This is a basic implementation of Chess, done through the command line. The board
itself is printed to the terminal, user input is taken in through command line, and
we are able to use the basic functions of chess. For this version, we have created a 
basic display of the board, and gave the user basic interactions in order to 
move pieces based on if the move itself is valid or not. User's will have a collection
of taken pieces displayed as well, making sure that the user is full caught up. 

PIECES: 
K - King
Q - Queen
R - Rook
N - Knight
B - Bishop
P - Pawn

HOW TO PLAY:
In order to play this game, the user will be prompted to enter in a move. The user will enter
the file and rank of the piece they want to move, following by the file and rank of the
destination. The user will then be told if the move is valid or not, and if it is valid, the
board is updated and the next player's turn begins. This is repeated for right now until the
program is exited. We have not implemented a checkmate, stalemate, or draw yet, so the game will
continue until the user exits the program.
